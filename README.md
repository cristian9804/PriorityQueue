# PriorityQueue
The python class PQueue  implements a priority queue using an array list of PQElement’s. In particular, it's implemented using these 5 functions
• one for creating an empty priority queue
• one for returning the size of the priority queue
• one for enqueueing a new PQ-element in the priority queue
• one for dequeueing from the priority queue the PQ-element with the greatest priority
• one that prints the elements of the priority queue into a string (call this one __str__)
